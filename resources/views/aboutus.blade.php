                    Neighbours: St. John’s is an interactive archive of stories from cultural communities in and
                    around St. John’s (Canada). It is part of a larger project about cultural diversity in our province
                    that has also resulted in a smartphone app. The stories included on this website range from
                    comical reflections on local traditions and experiences to tales that address the challenges faced
                    by newcomers to the province. Some of the stories are celebratory in tone, while others are more
                    challenging. We hope that they will inspire users of this website to listen more deeply to their
                    neighbours.

                    Background
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Between 2009 and 2011, the Research Centre for the Study of Music, Media, and Place
                    (MMaP) at Memorial University of Newfoundland conducted a research project entitled St.
                    John’s Many Voices. Led by MMaP’s founding director, Dr. Beverley Diamond, a team of
                    researchers conducted over ninety interviews with individuals from diverse ethnic and religious
                    communities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The resulting oral history archive contains interviews with individuals from diverse
                    ethnic and religious communities, as well as manuscripts, photographs, archival audiovisual
                    material, and new performance materials.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2014, MMaP hosted a day-long meeting with community stakeholders about the
                    creation of one or more exhibitions on cultural diversity, which would draw from the earlier
                    project. In attendance were representatives from a wide range of groups, including immigrant
                    organizations, museums and archives, city and provincial government departments, exhibit
                    designers, academic colleagues from across Memorial University of Newfoundland, the Harris
                    Centre for Regional Policy and Development, and the Office of Public Engagement at Memorial.
                    The meeting focused primarily on the question of how to extend the visibility of diversity in our
                    city. The idea of “neighbours” was adopted as an unifying theme. The participants felt that
                    projects emerging under the umbrella of the Neighbours Project should address questions of
                    belonging, different kinds of cultural alliances and connections (including intergenerational and
                    cross cultural ones), and ethnic diversity. The meeting participants emphasized that the project
                    should produce exhibits that are public, mobile, and interactive, and should speak to a wide range
                    of audiences.

                    How to use this website
                </h3>
                <p>
                    This website features fascinating stories from cultural communities in and around St. John’s. The
                    site contains audio stories, essays about cultural diversity and immigration in Newfoundland and
                    Labrador, and “community profiles” that provide insight into the histories and cultural traditions
                    of some of the cultural communities that are represented in the stories.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each story is tagged with keywords that allow you to navigate easily to topics that
                    interest you, as well as biographical information about the storyteller. There are several ways to
                    search for stories:

                <h3>The “Neighbours: St. John’s” Phone App</h3>
                <p>
                    We collaborated with award-winning radio documentarian Chris Brookes
                    <a href="http://batteryradio.weebly.com"> (Battery Radio) </a> to develop a free
                    phone app that makes available select stories from the St. John’s Many Voices, as well as
                    additional interviews conducted in 2016 by Chris Brookes, Beverley Diamond, and Meghan
                    Forsyth. Stories in the archive focus on immigration, belonging, and cultural connections. The
                    primary content of the app is 27 audio narratives, which are accompanied by new and archival
                    photographs, storyteller bios, community portraits, and links to related websites and online
                    videos.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The stories cover an extremely wide range of topics. You will hear stories about capelin,
                    Aboriginal culture, fashion dilemmas, raising children, and Minute Rice. You will hear from
                    Tony Silver, whose father was a stowaway on a Portuguese fishing ship and ended up in St.
                    John’s, where he founded a tailor shop on Freshwater Road. Mi’kmaq artist Jerry Evans talks
                    about the Shanawdithit monument in Bannerman Park and his Beothuk and Mi’kmaq heritage.
                    He relates his frustration with how Newfoundland and Labrador culture is often depicted as “all
                    things Irish.” You will also hear about Cubans defecting at Gander and a young woman’s
                    experience of wearing the hijab. These are just a few of many fascinating accounts featured on
                    the app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can access the app either as you walk downtown St. John’s (and some outlying
                    areas, such as Middle Cove Beach), or remotely, from the comfort of home. If the app is turned
                    on, your phone’s GPS will automatically alert you to a story that is connected to your location.
                    Using GPS, the app will not draw on your phone’s data plan.
                </p>
